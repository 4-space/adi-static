    <h3>The Columbia CS Mentorship Program pairs students interested in computer science & technology with passionate and experienced students in a wide array of fields. Pairs are chosen based on the compatibility of the mentor and menteeâ€™s personal, academic, and professional interests. Our goal is to foster a strong network and support system for students within the greater CS community at Columbia. The events help students learn about what it's like to be a CS major on campus, meet peers of diverse backgrounds within the CS community to earn advice, and build friendships!</h3>

    <h3>Mentees are generally first- and second-years, while mentors can be anyone with experience who is willing provide one-on-one feedback with mentees.</h3>
