This month, our topic will be the Centralization & Decentralization of technologyâ€”e.g. government surveillance of citizens through technology, rise of cryptocurrency, tech monopolies, and more.

We will explore this topic further through weekly threads discussions. These discussions are chill, thought-provoking conversations that take place during dinner or over coffee. As usual, no prior experience/knowledge required!
