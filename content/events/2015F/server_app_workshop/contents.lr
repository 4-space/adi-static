From creating a server with just a few commands to rapid development using AngularJS, this workshop will walk you through transforming an idea into an app. Weâ€™ll use the Node.js framework Loopback to define database models and relations with just a few keystrokes and Ionic, a framework based on Cordova and AngularJS, in unison to make a fully functional server and hybrid app.
