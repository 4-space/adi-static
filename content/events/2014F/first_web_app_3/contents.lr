Columbia Creates is a program to get Columbia students at all levels of experience making apps together. If you're a beginner, come to this event to learn to use to use APIs to connect your app to web services! This is the third part in a series of lectures that will teach you to build your first web app, using our tried and true DevFest curriculum.

Missed the workshop or want to get a head start? We're going to be following along with [this tutorial](http://old.adicu.com/intro-webdev/) developed by ADI's Dan Schlosser.  

**Suggested Prerequisites:** You should go through [ADI's environment setup tutorial](http://squidarth.github.io/Devfest-Environment-Setup/), which will allow you to run all code in a virtual environment, using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). If you prefer to run you programs locally, you should be able to run [`python`](https://www.python.org/) and [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) from your terminal or command prompt.
