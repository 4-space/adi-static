To kick things off, we're going to explore the emerging topics in Artificial Intelligence through a historical and ethical perspctive. Some of the questions we want to ask are:

- What are the major milestones in history that have allowed AI to be such an important topicâ€” for example, how AI is changing the way we think about transportation, communication, and personal assistance.
- What are the major points in the ethical debate around AI, especially from leaders in tech?

There will be activities, great discussion, and FREE FOOD!
