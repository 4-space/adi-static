This week, we'll be taking a look at adversarial inputs, which allow malicious adversaries to systematically fool machine learning algorithms. There are lots of good introductions to the topic: our favorites are:

- [Attacking Machine Learning with Adversarial Examples(https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/)
- [Breaking Convnets](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/03/30/breaking-convnets/)
- [Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf)

If you want to dig deeper, some papers we're looking at include:

- [Universal Adversarial Peturbations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08401.pdf)
- [Robust Adversarial Inputs](https://blog.openai.com/robust-adversarial-inputs/)

If you know of other good papers in this area, we'd love to hear it!

## FAQ

### Do I have to read everything listed?

Definiely not! While we expect you to take a look at at least one of the general introductions, we definitely don't expect you to read through all the papers we posted.

### What kind of background do I need?

Although we hope you'll spend some time exploring the area independently before-hand (this leads to much better discussions), you don't have to be a machine learning expert in any way! As long as you're comfortable reading academic papers and engaging with the literature, you should feel pretty comfortable with the discussion.
