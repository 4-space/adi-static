Throughout the evening at CCE, ADI will be hosting light dinner, answering questions, and running technical interview prep workshops so that you can brush up on the essential subjects covered in interviews.
To book your session, please click "register" and select ONE time slot. Sessions are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Please only sign up if you can definitely attend; and keep in mind that alumni/employers are donating their time so attendance is mandatory.
