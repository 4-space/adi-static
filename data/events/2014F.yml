    \ projects will teach you about open source licensing, collaboration tools, and\
    \ how free software projects are organized. In the afternoon, they'll help you\
    \ make contributions to open source projects. And throughout the day, they'll\
    \ feed you, get to know you, and talk with you about opportunities for students\
    \ in open source.\r\n\r\nOpen source software -- software that is shared freely\
    \ and available to build upon -- is a great way to apply your programming skills\
    \ to real-world projects and social causes. This event specially welcomes newcomers\
    \ to that style of development, and the day begins with teaching workshops that\
    \ anyone can follow.\r\n\r\nOpen source participation is one way to gain real-world\
    \ skills and make connections that will last you through your career. Volunteer\
