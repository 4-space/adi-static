    \ is a 10-week summer program in collaboration with Highland Capital Partners\
    \ that gives teams a $20,000 convertible note investment, office space, and security\
    \ mentorship from industry leaders at companies like Cisco, Imprivata, Akamai,\
    \ and SAP. We help early stage security companies through 1) providing the support\
    \ and mentoring to transform technical ideas into a commercial solution and 2)\
    \ building a network of entrepreneurs and investors interested in security companies.\
    \ \r\n\r\nWe had a successful pilot program last year, and we are running it again!\
    \ Here are the stories from the two teams that participated in our pilot program:\
    \ [Aikicrypt](https://medium.com/cybersecurity-factory/you-can-t-start-a-company-at-your-desk-12ceb2443484#.iggrilwqz)\

    \n\r\nThis year, we are introducing a [pilot program](https://medium.com/cybersecurity-factory/industry-partnership-pilot-program-for-cybersecurity-factory-2016-a7a367b4f726#.7hduhwzbt)\
    \ where a team will work closely with an industry partner to produce a relevant\
    \ security solution. \r\n\r\nMore information about the program is available on\
    \ [website](http://cybersecurityfactory.com/). Applications are now [open](https://cybersecurityfactory.wufoo.com/forms/qt8cv0t1hgi4up/)!\
    \ The early deadline is 2/26, and after that, we will accept applications on a\
    \ rolling basis until 3/21.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has questions about Cybersecurity\

    \ security research being done in universities, their barriers to adoption, and\
    \ the need to bridge the gap between academia and industry, motivating the formation\
    \ of a cybersecurity accelerator focused on students, [The Cybersecurity Factory](http://cybersecurityfactory.com/).\
