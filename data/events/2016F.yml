    \ aversion among young women. It exposes, too, the structural realities women\
    \ face as they become entrepreneurs, including lack of female role models and\

    \ to women-led companies.\r\nThere will be popcorn!\r\n**This event is open to\

  long_description: In this workshop, former ADI Alumni Jackie Ho will introduce you
    to the functions, skills, and tools of what she calls a "full-stack UIUX Designer".
    Hear about how she became a designer despite a lack of design class offering/community
    at Columbia and a sea of CS-majors. To solidify those learnings, the workshop
    will then challenge everyone to flex their hidden design talents in a hands-on
    design sprint simulation.
  short_description: "Ever wonder what it is exactly that UIUX designers do? Want\
    \ to learn about how you too can benefit from user-centered design thinking without\
    \ any \"creative\" or \"artistic\" skills?\r\n\r\n"

  long_description: nTopology is a NYC-based startup working to optimize 3D-printed
    part design. nTopology software offers a fluid transition from 3D model to fabricated
    component, and vastly increases the ease of creation of complex lattice structures.
    That ability enables 3D-printed parts to be lighter, stronger, and more efficiently
    manufactured than ever before. Learn more at http://www.ntopology.com/.
  short_description: nTopology provides lattice design tools for 3D printing. They'll
    be at Columbia to talk about the tech behind their unique platform!
